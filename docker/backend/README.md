## Project Structure

- `config/hivemq.conf`: Configuration settings for the HiveMQ MQTT Broker.
- `data/`: Directory for persisting data such as retained messages and client session information.
- `logs/`: Directory for storing log files generated by the HiveMQ broker.
- `docker-compose.yaml`: Defines the services, networks, and volumes for the Docker Compose project.
- `.env`: Contains environment variables for configuring the HiveMQ broker and other services.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

2. **Configure the Broker**
   Edit the `config/hivemq.conf` file to customize the broker settings as needed.

3. **Environment Variables**
   Update the `.env` file with any necessary environment variables.

4. **Start the Broker**
   Use Docker Compose to start the HiveMQ broker:
   ```bash
